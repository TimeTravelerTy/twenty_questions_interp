**Current milestone:** M4 — single-position pre-answer patching is comprehensively null across phases 1/2a/2b/2c-i (0 / 2280 flips-to-src on stable targets across {L29, L27-L48, L1-L48} × {turn 1, 2, 3, 4}). The class-decodable signal at L29-L48 (M3 turn-4 LR LOO 0.79) is legible but decisively off the reveal-token causal path. Phase 2c-ii (position-band patch) needs a moderate refactor + a research-judgment call from the user before implementation.
**Last agent:** Claude
**Last updated:** 2026-04-26 (M4 phase 2c-i done on job `7260593`: per-turn pre-answer all-layer patch sweep across turns 1, 2, 3 — three 400-trial experiments in one bundled job. **All three turns null on stable targets.** Across the full 1200 new trials, 1 lone "flip-to-src" at turn 3 was traced to attempt_581's 15% perturbation-fallback to horse (the same prior-attractor leakage seen in phase 2b), not a real causal effect. Combined with phases 1/2a/2b: 0 / 2280 genuine flips on the 19 stable targets across every single-position patch tested. See `docs/progress/M4-patch-turnsweep-null.md` and DECISIONS D-38. **Phase 2c-ii:** position-band patch with on-the-fly src forward-pass capture is the next structural test. NOT submitted autonomously — it's a moderate script refactor and the choice between "K=5 trailing scaffolding band at turn 4", "shift to turn-0 Ready output position", or "positional probing sweep first to localize where class signal enters" is a research-judgment call worth user input.)

**North star:** *Calibration is infra; the scientific claim is self-chosen only.*
Do not headline calibration-only results.

**Result so far (12B calibration is good; turn-4 self-chosen is the first useful probe position):**

1. **20-bank prompt beats the 4-candidate panel.** Greedy 4B no longer
   collapses to only salmon/frog. Over 200 attempts: dolphin 104 / penguin 85 /
   shark 5 / crocodile 2 / horse 2 / cow 1 / salmon 1; 7 classes appear and 5
   reach quota `n=2`.
2. **4B Ready geometry is still weak.** On the realized 5-way subset
   (`dolphin,horse,penguin,crocodile,shark`), self-chosen best post-L13 NC is
   **10.0%** (chance 20%) and post-L13 within-between contrast is **+4.70e-06**.
3. **Matched persistence is strong.** State A and B both hit **100% NC at L21**,
   cross A→B is **90%**, and State B contrast is **+4.87e-04**. Self-chosen is
   about **104× weaker than matched persistence State B** on contrast.
4. **Matched calibration still fails at 4B.** `name_paraphrase` scores only
   **34/40 = 85.0%** on the same 5-way subset, so it is not ready to standardize.
5. **12B improves self-chosen behavior, but the old 4-question panel was broken.**
   Greedy 12B over 100 attempts realizes 4 classes and reaches **37.5% NC** at
   L15, but the legacy panel is non-diagnostic there because every class shares
   the same `1,0,0,1` fingerprint.
6. **A six-question matched panel fixes that and clears the gate.** On
   `is_carnivore,is_larger_than_human,is_domesticated,lives_in_africa,produces_dairy_milk,is_ridden_by_humans`,
   matched persistence stays strong (`7226546`: 45/48 = 93.8%, NC-A 100% at L30)
   and matched calibration with **`name_paraphrase`** passes (`7226547`:
   **47/48 = 97.9%**).
7. **The narrowed 4-way self-chosen prompt is a dead end at 12B.** Re-running
   self-chosen directly on `{elephant,cow,dog,horse}` (job `7230657`) realizes
   only `cow` and `horse` over 160 attempts; `elephant` and `dog` never appear.
8. **Calibration -> self-chosen Ready transfer still fails at 12B.** On the
   balanced kept 4-way run, agreement vs reveal at `L6/L17/L27/L48` is
   NC `0.35/0.00/0.00/0.10` and LR `0.00/0.00/0.00/0.10`. On the earlier
   natural 20-bank 12B self-chosen slice (2 x `{elephant,cow,dog,horse}`),
   transfer is only `0.125-0.25`, i.e. chance.
9. **Self-chosen Ready direct-fit is also weak (decisive).** Job `7230807`,
   300 attempts on the 20-bank prompt, 40 kept runs balanced 10/class.
   LOO over all 49 layers: NC mean 0.23 / max 0.45 @ L14; LR mean 0.27 /
   max 0.45 @ L4 (chance 0.25). Best layers disagree between NC and LR,
   consistent with noise + a weak underlying signal. Calibration on the
   same 4 classes saturates at 1.00 from L6 (LR) / L27 (NC). So at 12B,
   Ready-state self-chosen geometry itself is the bottleneck, **not**
   calibration->self-chosen transfer.
10. **Turn-4 pre-answer is materially stronger than Ready.** On the same 40
    kept self-chosen runs, turn 4 pre-answer reaches NC mean **0.40** /
    max **0.625 @ L44** and LR mean **0.40** / max **0.60 @ L42**. The
    signal forms a broad late-layer band (L27-48 means: NC **0.549**,
    LR **0.539**). Turn 1 is moderate, turns 2-3 are weak. So the right
    lesson is not "later is always better"; it is that **turn 4 pre-answer**
    is the first clearly probe-usable self-chosen position we have found.
11. **This turn-4 signal is a latent-state result, not public-history leakage.**
    On the realized kept subset `{elephant,cow,dog,horse}`, the 4-question
    panel is degenerate (`1,0,0,1` for every class). So the turn-4 decode
    cannot be coming from publicly distinguishing yes/no history.
12. **Scale-up (n=80, 20/class) crystallizes the turn-4 signal decisively.**
    Job `7232075`, same 20-bank prompt, same 4-question panel. On turn 4:
    LR LOO **0.787 @ L31** / NC **0.662 @ L29** (chance 0.25). Broad
    coherent L27-48 band: **LR mean 0.731**, NC mean 0.558. Compared to
    the n=40 pilot, LR jumps +0.19 in both mean and max while NC barely
    moves — consistent with linearly separable geometry that was only
    regularization-starved at n=40. Turn 1 L27-48 LR mean 0.431 remains
    above chance but well below turn 4. The STATUS ~70% threshold for
    locking this probe position is cleared.

Bottom line: at **12B**, the self-chosen class code is decodable at
**turn-4 pre-answer, late layers (L26-L48, peaks near L29-L31)**. LR
0.79 at L31 is ~3.2x chance and the signal is coherent across depth. That
position is locked for M4.

**Pilot done (2026-04-21):** 100-run 12B `name_paraphrase` calibration on
`{elephant,cow,dog,horse}` with the six-question panel (job `7226576`). Local
Ready readouts across all 49 layers:

- **LR LOO saturates at 1.00 by L6**, stays saturated to L48.
- **NC LOO climbs 0.25→0.66 @ L7→0.93 @ L16→1.00 from L27.**
- Six binary attribute decoders all 1.00 from L7 (trivial at 4 classes × 25).

The LR ≫ NC gap at L6–L26 is still the main calibration-side structural signal:
candidate identity is linearly available from ~1/4 depth, but class clusters are
not spherical until much deeper. Transfer, however, is now the decisive result:
see `docs/progress/M3-12b-selfchosen-transfer.md`.

**Next concrete step (M4 phase 2c-ii) — needs user input first.**
Phase 2c-i closed the "single-position pre-answer at any turn" branch
with 0 / 2280 genuine flips on stable targets. The natural next test
is a **position-band patch**: replace src's residuals across a window
of positions in tgt, all layers, see if reveals flip. Three possible
shapes for that experiment, each with different scope/cost:

(a) **K=5 trailing-scaffolding band at turn 4 pre-answer.** Patch the
    last 5 prefill tokens (`<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n`),
    which are token-aligned across runs without per-run alignment
    work. Cheapest variant. Tests whether the class commitment is
    spread across the immediate scaffolding band rather than living
    on a single token. Engineering: add a "live src capture" path
    (forward-pass src up to qN-preanswer with `output_hidden_states=True`
    and grab a position window) plus a `--position-window K` CLI.

(b) **Shift the patch site to turn-0 Ready output position.** In the
    self-chosen condition the model first emits `Ready` after
    silently picking an animal — plausibly the class-commitment
    write site. Single-position patch at the Ready token, all layers.
    Engineering: add a context builder that ends at Ready (instead of
    a turn-N pre-answer) plus the live-capture path. Different
    structural hypothesis from (a): "earlier in the dialogue" rather
    than "wider on the same position."

(c) **Positional probing sweep first.** Before another patching
    experiment, run `decode_turns.py` (or a positional variant) to
    map *where* in the residual stream the class signal first
    becomes decodable. Currently we only have probe scores at
    pre-answer positions of each turn; extending to all positions of
    the prefix would tell us the earliest position where LR LOO is
    above chance, which would inform which position to patch.

Each is the right next test under a different working hypothesis.
(a) bets on a small coordinated multi-token write at the turn-4
boundary. (b) bets on early commitment at the Ready token. (c) bets
that we should localize-then-patch rather than guess-then-patch.

Pausing autonomous execution until the user picks a direction.

**Side investigations still pending (non-blocking):**
- `attempt_588` baseline non-determinism is reproducible across all
  four turn replays — not transient, but a persistent divergence from
  the original streaming-collection forward pass. Worth a short
  investigation if future patching depends on horse trial reliability.
- First-step logit-diff metric is unreliable for dog (reveals don't
  begin with the ` Dog` token). Upgrade to multi-step scan when any
  positive signal emerges and metric sensitivity becomes load-bearing.

**Methodological follow-up (deferred to whichever phase produces a
positive signal):** the first-step logit-diff metric is unreliable for
classes whose reveal doesn't begin with the animal-name token (dog at
phase 2a). When a positive signal emerges, upgrade the metric to scan
several generation steps and locate where the animal-name token first
becomes argmax-favored.

**Side investigation (non-blocking):** `attempt_588` is non-deterministic
at `do_sample=False`. On-disk reveal `horse`, replayed reveal `cow`. Same
prompt, same kwargs. Suspect KV-cache or attention-impl drift in
bfloat16. Worth ~30min of investigation before relying on horse trials
in subsequent patching work.

**Do not:**
- repeat 4-way narrowed self-chosen prompts (collapse is established)
- probe "State A/B" in the self-chosen condition — the concept does not
  apply there
- spend more cycles on Ready-state self-chosen decoding as the main branch
- sweep more positions on the 80-run dataset — turn-4 L26-48 is locked
- run a bare single-position layer sweep as the next M4 experiment.
  Heimersheim & Nanda 2024 recommend low-granularity (band) interventions
  *first*, then refine. A bare layer sweep nulls under both the
  redundancy and off-path interpretations and is non-diagnostic.

**Open threads on the backlog:**
- **Bigger-model ladder (D-05):** 4B's salmon attractor may be model-specific.
  At 12B+ the distribution could sharpen differently or flatten; re-run both
  `diagnose_persistence.py` and `diagnose_selfchosen_ready.py` when we scale.
- **Bank improvement:** disputed cells in the 20×30 table
  (`docs/progress/M3-binding-bank-audit.md`) touched `frog.has_four_legs`,
  which showed up in both self-chosen smokes' 53% correctness number. Not
  blocking the 20-candidate run, still worth a broader audit pass.

Scientific ground truth remains self-chosen. Keep publishing only self-chosen
results as the headline.

## Open questions

- HF license approval for Gemma 3 1B is pending. Without it, M2 scales only to
  open models (Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Llama-3.2 if granted, etc.). The plan keeps
  Gemma 3 as the target (D-05); using a non-Gemma model for M2's scientific
  exit criterion would break downstream SAE/transcoder reuse at M5.
- Exact middle-layer target for Gemma 3 1B (26 layers → probably layer 13–18).
  Defer: M2 captures *all* layers, picked empirically from the sweep.
- Question-regime choice for M2 dialogues (ambiguity-first vs. disambiguation-first).
  Defer to M3; M2 is Ready-only, no questions yet.
- Whether to include a 21st "I don't know / none of the above" option to catch
  non-commitment. Deferred; current bet is the model will pick one under the prompt.

---

## Known risks

- **Probe transfer from calibration to self-chosen may fail.** The core scientific
  risk. Mitigation: build the feasible-set control (`S_t`) into the first cut so
  we can ask whether the signal exceeds what public dialogue trivially reveals.
- **Instruction-following failures on Gemma 3 1B.** The 1B may not reliably emit
  `Ready` alone, may leak the secret, may refuse self-choice. Track parse-success
  rate in M2 as an explicit metric.
- **Gemma Scope / circuit-tracer maturity.** SAE artifacts exist for Gemma 3 but
  circuit-tracer's NNsight backend is flagged experimental. Plan to do readouts
  and patching *without* circuit-tracer first; add it only for the case studies.
- **Introspection unreliability.** Treat the end-of-game reveal only as sanity
  check, never as ground truth for `ẑ_0`.
